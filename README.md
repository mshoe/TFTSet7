ORIGINS

**Astral**



**Guild**




**Jade**




**Mirage**

Yone carry - duelist <br />
Nunu carry - warlord, dawnbringer, executioner <br />
Frontline - electric overload, dawnbringer <br />

Daeja - i think this champ sucks, but probably duelist, spellsword <br />

test

**Ragewing**



**Revel**
works on instances of damage. Broken on xayah, good interaction with mage double cast



**Scalescorn**
olaf kinda decent
probably good with shiv/spark for a 4 scalescorn comp

**Shimmerscale**

**Tempest**
Ornn is good cc, but he NEEDs good tank items so he can survive to get the knockup
Ezreal is weird, bis = deathcap, hoj, guinsoos/bb?

**Trainer**
2 trainer is REALLY good frontline early game, probably a decent transition for mage or cannoneer comps

**Whisper**
Syfen looks like a decent melee adc
pyke is probably broken


CLASSES
**Assassin**
Diana really good 3 cost carry
Talon really good 4 cost carry
Pyke insane lategame unit

There probably is going to be a kayne qiyana 2 cost reroll comp

**Bruiser**
Decent frontline trait that falls off lategame like always
Maybe archangel skarner with tahm kench 1-cost reroll
Syfen: charges at farthest enemy within 2 hexes => likely never gets to charge to backline (3 hexes away)
Maybe 3 cost reroll like illaoi olaf sylas + shen
There is probably not a good vertical bruiser comp like set 4.5

**Cannoneer**
Really good adc trait, senna sett 1-cost reroll potentially
Tristana jinx trainer 2-cost reroll
Corki jinx good late game dps
Likely a decent emblem on swiftshots

**Cavalier**
Good emblem for melee carries, also Cavalier unity
Nunu is probably a decent secondary carry in mirage comps

**Dragon**
expensive

**Dragonmancer**
Swain and volibear are the premier carries
Yasuo pretty good late game, although a bit underpowered rn

karma, sett, senna, swain for 3 dragonmancer 3 ragewing 1 cost reroll

**Evoker**
Anivia is a huge carry right now
Lulu is good utility
Probably OP with a blue buff user to help gen mana, Yasuo lategame?

**Guardian**
Weirdge, only 1 costs and 2 costs excluding dragon. Idas is pretty good unit, but shimmerscale item is usually not worth it if you aren't already running shimmerscale early game.

**Legend**
Very difficult trait to use, you probably do NOT want to itemize your sacrifice. Actually best to eat makeshift armor trash units or a trash cavalier (cuz of armor/mr stats). Probably don't feed shit to your anivia or ornn, this trait is pretty much just for volibear.

**Mage**
Interesting trait. Pretty sure ryze sucks as solo carry. Nami carry reroll is probably good.

**Mystic**
mystic jade comp for Shi Oh carry?

**Shapeshifter**
swain shyvanna share shapeshifter ragewing
gnar neeko share shapeshifter jade, both provide cc and frontline
nidalee and elise look like they are supposed to be dps

**Swiftshot**
Ezreal might be ok 1 cost reroll, dunno
Xayah is nuts 4 cost carry
Twitch is very splashable with guild
Varus cc is very good

**Warrior**
pretty good, yone and olaf are both good carries
