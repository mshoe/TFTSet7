TIER 2

**Axiom Arc**

**Better Together**

chalice chalice chalice locket locket locket??

**Cluttered Mind**

Don't have experience with this yet, but I'm pretty sure you hold every pair so you have highest chance to natural a strong board. You lose econ intervals, but you technically gain 5 gold worth of exp every round for it. So if you are always going to push levels, then this is equivalent to being 50 gold econ each round. Might need to do some math to figure out when you need to start building up real gold to roll with

**Devastating Charge**

Cavalier reroll??

**Dragon Alliance/Dragon Horde**

Probably really bad. I think this is a 4fun augment designed for youtube video highlights

**Essence theft**

GUINSOOS ZEKES RFC??? 4 EVOKERS??
This is 5/8 the power of a shojin on your carry even if you ignore the part where the enemy loses mana

**Eternal Protection**

if you can also heal your jade statues somehow, this sounds fking NUTS

**Evoker Crest**

Any comp that has high mana carry + low mana other units can probably use this as a better shojin

**Eye of the Storm**

pretty good for sins or a middle dragon carry? Yasuo, maybe voli

**Gadget Expert**

Shiv sunfire morello spark

**Gear Upgrades**

vertical guild, is broooken

**Hallucinate**

sounds broken on stacking/scaling comps, like mirage-duelist, tempest, ascension, archangels, guinsoos

**Mage Conference**

Reroll mages like yordles?? or just use as econ augment and natural 2 stars. Probably nami main carry

**Pandoras bench**

mathematically, if rolling for 2 cost, and you hold 3 units you don't want, and you are rolling for 2 units you do want, then the chances you roll one of them should be about ~40% each round

**Party Favors**

spam revel units, probably super good with revel emblem on xayah or mages

**Party Time!**

eh, not bad

**Penitence**

kinda meh

**Personal Training**

sounds Wokege with shapeshifter carries. Maybe dawnbringer yone with shen is also good.

**Press the attack**

vertical swiftshots probably good with this

**Reckless Spending**

This sounds hit or miss, but probably super fun. Shimmerscale items usually gen gold

**Ricochet**

Probably rly good

**Scorch**

Every 5th instance sounds not that good.

**Secret Snax**

just have to commit to trainer reroll with this. With 3 trainers, you are on avg feeding 4 snacks a round instead of 3.

**Tantrum**

sounds nuts for vertical ragewing, and hecarim

**Tiamat**

pretty good for olaf, probably meh on yone

**Titanic Strength**

Olaf bruiser reroll augment most likely
